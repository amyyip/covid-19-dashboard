# covid-19-dashboard
COVID-19 Dashboard that tracks confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths by country from 12/25/2019 to 10/9/2020.Â 

I downloaded a data set from data.world that tracked the confirmed cases and deaths and I downloaded a different data set for recovered cases from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases. I joined the two csv's in Tableau on report date to combine the data sets.
